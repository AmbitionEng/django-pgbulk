# Changelog

## 3.1.0

#### Feature

  - Add support for db defaults in `pgbulk.upsert` by [@max-muoto](https://github.com/max-muoto) in [#42](https://github.com/Opus10/django-pgbulk/pull/42).

## 3.0.2

#### Trivial

  - Remove elipses defaults on overloads to avoid incorrect resolution by [@max-muoto](https://github.com/max-muoto) in [#41](https://github.com/Opus10/django-pgbulk/pull/41/).

## 3.0.1

#### Trivial

  - Add overloads on `upsert`, `aupsert`, `update`, and `aupdate` to improve type-checking on `returning=...` by [@max-muoto](https://github.com/max-muoto) in [#40](https://github.com/Opus10/django-pgbulk/pull/40/).

## 3.0.0

#### Breaking Changes

  - The `redundant_updates` flag for `pgbulk.upsert` was renamed to `ignore_unchanged`, and the default behavior was flipped by [@wesleykendall](https://github.com/wesleykendall) in [#38](https://github.com/Opus10/django-pgbulk/pull/38).

    Unlike before, unchanged rows are *not* ignored by default. See [the pull request](https://github.com/Opus10/django-pgbulk/pull/38) for a guide on how to update invocations from version 2.

#### Features

  - Support update expressions, `returning`, and `ignore_unchanged` in `pgbulk.update` by [@wesleykendall](https://github.com/wesleykendall) in [#38](https://github.com/Opus10/django-pgbulk/pull/38)

    `pgbulk.update`'s interface has reached feature parity with `pgbulk.upsert`, allowing for returning results, ignoring unchanged rows from being updated, and bulk updates with expressions.

  - New `pgbulk.copy` function that leverages `COPY ... FROM` by [@wesleykendall](https://github.com/wesleykendall) in [#39](https://github.com/Opus10/django-pgbulk/pull/39)

    `pgbulk.copy` wraps Postgres's `COPY ... FROM` to insert data. Can be dramatically faster than Django's `bulk_create`.

#### Changes

  - Django 5.1 compatibilty, dropped Django 3.2 / Postgres 12 support by [@wesleykendall](https://github.com/wesleykendall) in [#37](https://github.com/Opus10/django-pgbulk/pull/37).

#### Feature

  - Fix typing errors allowing for strict type-safety with Pyright. [Maxwell Muoto, 8158596]

## 2.4.0 (2024-04-24)

#### Bug

  - Fix operations on virtual and generated fields. [Darlin Alberto, 852a492]

    Using non-concrete fields such as django-hashids HashidsField and the new
    Generatedfield in Django 5 previously produced errors during upsert and
    update operations. These fields are now fully supported.

## 2.3.1 (2024-04-06)

#### Feature

  - Add `exclude` arguments to `pgbulk.upsert` and `pgbulk.update`. [Maxwell Muoto, cde5904]

    Add `exclude` arguments to `pgbulk.upsert` and `pgbulk.update`.

    Users can now use `exclude=["field_name"]` to exclude fields for updating or upserting data.

## 2.2.0 (2023-11-26)

#### Feature

  - Django 5.0 compatibility [Wesley Kendall, e7848ed]

## 2.1.0 (2023-11-03)

#### Bug

  - Allow updates on custom primary key fields [Wesley Kendall, 4dbfb1c]

    `pgbulk.update` would fail on models with custom primary key fields when
    no `update_fields` argument was supplied. This has been fixed.

## 2.0.4 (2023-10-10)

#### Trivial

  - Improve base type annotations, avoid type annotations in comments [Maxwell Muoto, 862e253]

## 2.0.0 (2023-10-08)

#### Api-Break

  - Python 3.12 / async support, dropping of `pgbulk.sync` and `return_untouched` [Wesley Kendall, de70607]

    This version of `django-pgbulk` breaks the API in the following manner:

    - `pgbulk.upsert` no longer supports the `return_untouched` argument. It had race conditions and will only be brought back if those race conditions can be addressed.
    - `pgbulk.upsert`'s `ignore_duplicate_updates` was renamed to `redundant_updates`. The default functionality is still the same, but the argument now has the opposite meaning.
    - `pgbulk.sync` was dropped since it relied on the `return_untouched` argument.

    This release also includes the following changes:

    - Python 3.12 is supported and Python 3.7 is dropped
    - Postgres 16 support
    - Async-compatible `pgbulk.aupsert` and `pgbulk.aupdate` were added
    - New documentation theme and formatting with Material for Mkdocs
    - Type annotations for public functions and classes

## 1.4.0 (2023-06-08)

#### Feature

  - Added Python 3.11, Django 4.2, and Psycopg 3 support [Wesley Kendall, f606b0b]

    Adds Python 3.11, Django 4.2, and Psycopg 3 support along with tests for multiple Postgres versions. Drops support for Django 2.2.

## 1.3.0 (2022-12-12)

#### Feature

  - Sort bulk update objects [Wesley Kendall, f766617]

    Objects passed to ``pgbulk.update`` are now sorted to reduce the likelihood of
    a deadlock when executed concurrently.

## 1.2.0 (2022-03-14)

#### Feature

  - Handle func-based fields and allow expressions in upserts [Wes Kendall, 64458c5]

    ``pgbulk.upsert`` allows users to provide a ``pgbulk.UpdateField`` object
    to the ``update_fields`` argument, allowing a users to specify an expression
    that happens if an update occurs.

    This allows, for example, a user to do ``models.F('my_field') + 1`` and
    increment integer fields in a ``pgbulk.upsert``.

    Along with this, fields that cast to ``Func`` and other expressions are
    properly handled during upsert.

## 1.1.1 (2022-03-14)

#### Trivial

  - Updates to latest template, dropping py3.6 support and adding Django4 support [Wes Kendall, 35a04b0]

## 1.1.0 (2022-01-08)

#### Bug

  - Fix error when upserting custom AutoFields [Wes Kendall, 114eb45]

    has been tested and fixed.

## 1.0.0 (2020-06-27)

#### Api-Break

  - Initial release of django-pgbulk. [Wes Kendall, 7070a26]

    The initial release of django-pgbulk includes three functions for
    bulk operations in postgres:

    1. ``pgbulk.update`` - For updating a list of models in bulk. Although Django
       provides a ``bulk_update`` in 2.2, it performs individual updates for
       every row and does not perform a native bulk update.
    2. ``pgbulk.upsert`` - For doing a bulk update or insert. This function uses
       postgres ``UPDATE ON CONFLICT`` syntax to perform an atomic upsert
       operation. There are several options to this function that allow the
       user to avoid touching rows if they result in a duplicate update, along
       with returning which rows were updated, created, or untouched.
    3. ``pgbulk.sync`` - For syncing a list of models with a table. Does a bulk
       upsert and also deletes any rows in the source queryset that were not
       part of the input data.
